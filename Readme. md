# LSTM Model for Predicting Output Parameters

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- tensorflow
- keras-tuner

Install them with:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy tensorflow keras-tuner
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Place Your Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is named `your_dataset.csv` and is in the same directory as the script.

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python lstm_model.py
   ```

## Explanation

- **Data Preparation**: The script loads the dataset, separates input and output columns, splits the data into training and testing sets, and standardizes it.
- **Model Building and Tuning**: Uses Keras Tuner to find the best hyperparameters for the LSTM model.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model with the best hyperparameters and evaluates its performance.
- **Prediction**: Makes predictions on the test set and prints the results.

## Example Output

```text
Optimal hyperparameters found.
Test Loss: 0.045
Test MAE: 0.18
[[output predictions]]
```

Replace placeholders like the repository URL and dataset filename with actual values.
